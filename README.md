Hello my name is Nakshatra Singh Rawat and I am a front-end developer.
I love to create beautiful UI design for Websites.

WHTA DOES MY PORTFOLIO CONTAINS????
Well there some basics project for front-end like basic landing pages, movie app UI, music app, video application, weather app. etc. and all of them are responsive.
I mostly focused on the UI part more than the UX part.

These projects are quiet good for practise cause they are simple and easy to understand code.

Note: Some of the project contains LP in there, LP is short for landing page.
